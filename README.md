# SpeechSage-Backend
Project Overview
SpeechSage Backend is a server-side application designed to support the SpeechSage platform, which helps users analyze audio files for speech patterns and stammering detection. The backend handles the uploading, processing, and storage of audio analysis results, providing a reliable API for frontend and other clients to interact with.

Key Features
Receives and processes audio uploads.

Performs analysis and stores detailed results.

Maintains timestamps for all uploaded audio files.

Provides RESTful endpoints to retrieve analysis data.

Uses PostgreSQL for robust and scalable data persistence.

Built with Spring Boot and JPA for easy database management.

Technologies Used
Java with Spring Boot framework

PostgreSQL relational database

Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) for ORM

REST API architecture

Setup and Usage
To run the SpeechSage Backend, you need to have Java and PostgreSQL installed on your machine. The backend requires a PostgreSQL database with an appropriate schema to store audio analysis results.

Configuration is managed through application properties, where database connection details and other environment settings are specified.

Once configured, the backend can be started, and it will listen for incoming requests on the configured port (default is 8080). It exposes REST endpoints that allow clients to upload audio files and query stored analysis results.

API Overview
The backend provides APIs to:

Upload audio files and trigger speech analysis.

Retrieve the list of all audio analysis results.

Fetch detailed analysis for individual audio entries.

These APIs enable seamless integration with frontend applications or other client systems.
